# test-ember-tooltips

This project demonstrates the error that occurs when using an instance of the `line-clamp` component followed in the same page by two or more instances of the `ember-tooltip` component. An error occurs and the page is blank.
Just removing one of the ember-tooltip components will render the page just fine
